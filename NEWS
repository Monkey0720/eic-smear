Changes from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1
---------------------------

* Improved handling of Jacquet-Blondel and double-angle kinematic calculations
  for smeared data. Calculations now use momentum to compute energy if a
  measurement of momentum is available, and only use energy if there is no
  momentum measurement. This operates on the assumption that momentum
  resolution will generally be superior to energy resolution.
* Added an event class for the gmc_trans event generator.
* Added some extra methods to event and particle classes related to interface
  with eRHIC PYTHIA code and for propagation of information through smearing.
* Minor changes to configure/make files.
