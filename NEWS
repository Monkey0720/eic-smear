Changes for 1.0.2:

* Monte Carlo events now store tracks in a TClonesArray instead of vector.
  This change requires old trees to be reproduced.
* No longer attempts to build PYTHIA-dependent components if a PYTHIA library
  is not provided to configure.
* Bug fixes for some compilation and stability issues.
* Improvements to kinematic calculations, including support for
  charged-current events in Jacquet-Blondel method.
* Modification to intrinsic resolution function used in generic tracking
  formula.
* Support for polarised Djangoh events.
* Additional checks on integrity of ASCII input.
* Other minor code cleanups and textual improvements.

Changes for 1.0.1:

* Support for gmc_trans events.
* Support for DPMJet events.
* Support for hadronic events (p + p etc.).
* Added PerfectID class to smearing code allowing exact duplication of
  particle ID.
* Added external utility to convert tppmc output to eic-smear format
  compatible with smearing.
* Added specialised PlanerTracker and RadialTracker classes implementing
  generic momentum resolution functions.
* Modifications to hadronic kinematic calculations.
* Improvements to configure/make, including corrections to configure options.
* Significant code restructuring, especially in smearing portions, including
  file structure, class names and additional methods.
* Other bug fixes, stability improvements and code cleanup.

Changes for 1.0.0:

* Initial release.
