Changes for 1.0.2:

* Monte Carlo events now store tracks in a TClonesArray instead of vector.
  This change requires old trees to be reproduced.
* No longer attempts to build PYTHIA-dependent components if a PYTHIA library
  is not provided to configure.
* Bug fixes for some compilation and stability issues.
* Improvements to kinematic calculations, including support for
  charged-current events in Jacquet-Blondel method.
* Modification to intrinsic resolution function used in generic tracking
  formula.
* Support for polarised Djangoh events.
* Additional checks on integrity of ASCII input.
* Other minor code cleanups and textual improvements.
